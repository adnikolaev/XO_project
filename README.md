These files are about creating AI which can play in Tic-Tac-Toe (or bigger configuration) through some well-known algorithms.
That is what my course work was about.

Algorithms that I used:
  1. Minimax
  2. Alpha-beta pruning
  3. Monte Carlo tree search

Also I had tried to create neural network which can be trained through the game process but learning takes lots of time for achieve any nice results.
